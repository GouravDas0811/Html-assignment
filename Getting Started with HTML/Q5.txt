The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. Itâ€™s not an HTML tag, but an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple: <!DOCTYPE html>. However, in older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more complicated because it must refer to a DTD (Document Type Definition).
